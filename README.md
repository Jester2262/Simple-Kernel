# Simple-Kernel
A bare-metal x86-64 kernel for use with https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-UEFI-Bootloader

**Coming Soon** -- See the "Releases" tab for some samples that can be used with the above bootloader.

Current Status: Got font rendering to work and string output. Need to implement formatted text output (i.e. printf's '%' modifier), and clean up the code.

The currently uploaded code will not compile as-is. Kernel64.c is just here to show that this part of the project does also exist.   
  
A full description of how to actually compile it, etc. will be added once I finish my to-do list and clean up the mess of code. See the "Issues" section of this repo for some things on my to-do list.

Note: As far as licensing is concerned, this will be licensed like https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-UEFI-Bootloader, so here's a copy-pasteable citation:
