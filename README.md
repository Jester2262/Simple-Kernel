# Simple-Kernel
A bare-metal x86-64 kernel for use with https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-UEFI-Bootloader

**Coming Soon**

Current Status: Got font rendering to work and string output. Need to implement formatted text output (i.e. printf's '%' modifier), remove unnecessary GNU-EFI includes, and clean up the code.

The currently uploaded code will not compile as-is. Kernel64.c is just here to show that it's real and things are indeed happening. A full description of how to actually compile, etc. will be added once I finish my to-do list and clean up the mess of code.
