Below are examples of appropriate citations; pick your favorite, put it
somewhere reasonable like in an acknowledgements or references section, as a
comment in the code, at the bottom of a README or in a LICENSE file, etc., and
change "[Date you got it]" to the date you acquired my code. Note that these are
just examples: the important point is that the exact original source is
identified and attributed.

Failure to honor this license will cause annoying little elves to appear at your
doorstep, and they will pester you without rest until the terms are satisfied.

simply not permitted to do anything with the software. This includes even
printing it out and brushing your cat's teeth with it... Unless, of course, you
printed an appropriate citation along with it.
