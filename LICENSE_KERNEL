This software is provided free of charge in hopes that it may be useful, and it
can be downloaded and used in whole or in part. However, by using, copying,
modifying, and/or distributing this software you agree, implicitly, to the
following terms:

1) You will appropriately credit this project when and where code directly
derived from it is implemented, even if what is implemented is just a small part
of this codebase.

Below are examples of appropriate citations; pick your favorite, put it
somewhere reasonable like in an acknowledgements or references section, as a
comment in the code, at the bottom of a README or in a LICENSE file, etc., and
change "[Date you got it]" to the date you acquired my code. Note that these are
just examples: the important point is that the exact original source is
identified and attributed.

Short:
// From V0.8 of https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-Kernel

Medium:
// From KNNSpeed's "Simple Kernel," V0.8:
// https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-Kernel

Long (Recommended):
// From KNNSpeed's "Simple Kernel":
// https://github.com/KNNSpeed/Simple-Kernel
// V0.8, [Date you got it]

The last line of the long form might look like:

Failure to honor this license will cause annoying little elves to appear at your
doorstep, and they will pester you without rest until the terms are satisfied.
...Not really: for as long as you do not comply with this license, you are
simply not permitted to do anything with the software. This includes even
printing it out and brushing your cat's teeth with it... Unless, of course, you
printed an appropriate citation along with it.
